# CS50-Finance
As part of the CS50 web track, was tasked to make a web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. 
This web app will allow you to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let you buy and sell stocks listed in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) by querying IEX's API.
